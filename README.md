#Mutiple linear regression using python
This project demonstrates the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression using Python to analyze and predict outcomes based on multiple independent variables. The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are used to build and visualize the regression model. The project focuses on understanding the relationship between variables, interpreting coefficients, and measuring model performance using appropriate metrics. This project is useful for beginners in data science and machine learning who want hands-on experience with regression techniques and real-world data analysis.--
